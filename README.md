# CollegeAI_DownloadedAPI

Ok so I am very tired so this will be probably nonsense, but here is my best attempt at making this possible to use:

if you have poetry installed, just do "poetry install" and then change the config.yaml file for the colleges and traits about them that you want to get. Then, run
```py
python database_retrieval.py
```

and it'll get all the info for you. If you don't have poetry, get python. Then run:
```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

and then do the steps after poetry install before.

Or just use the "college_info.csv" file directly, whatever you want to.

also lmao if you use this star the repo, i want clout
